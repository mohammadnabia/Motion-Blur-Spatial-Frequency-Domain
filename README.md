# Motion-Blur-Spatial-Frequency-Domain
This repository provides Python code and tutorials for simulating motion blur in images and restoring them using spatial and frequency domain techniques. Explore motion blur effects, apply blur in both domains, and restore original images. Ideal for image processing and computer vision projects.
